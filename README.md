# ListServer
This repository is for the [List](https://github.com/HoldenErnest/List) application but it is also used as a ground to create my LupuServer as it will need setup before the project can be underway.

Read [notes](notes.md) for more information on startup of the System as a whole

## Goals:
- get ssh working âœ”
- get certbot working
- get apache working?
